// ***** chatGPT *****
// In JavaScript, functions follow closure properties, meaning they capture variables from their surrounding scope.
// 1.	Functions in useEffect rely on closures ‚Üí If a function inside useEffect captures an outdated value, it might behave incorrectly.
// 2.	To avoid using stale functions, we put them in the dependency array so React re-creates them when needed.
// 	‚Ä¢	We put dispatch in [] because, if it ever changes, we need to update our function.
//  ‚Ä¢	We put functions like loadEverything in [] because they depend on dispatch and should always have the latest version.
//  ‚Ä¢	Not just state & props go in [], but also functions or any value that might affect execution due to closures.



// üîÅ Full React Execution Flow:

// 1. Module Load Phase (One-Time Execution)
// 	‚Ä¢	Before any component renders, React (via Webpack/Vite) loads all modules.
// 	‚Ä¢	Each module is executed once.
// 	‚Ä¢	All import/export, context providers, and constants are initialized.
// 	‚Ä¢	This is when things like const socket = io() or createContext() are run.

// 2. Render Phase
// 	‚Ä¢	React starts rendering from the root component (<App />) provided to ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(<App/>).
// 	‚Ä¢	Whenever a component is rendered:
// 	‚Ä¢	It executes its function body.
// 	‚Ä¢	Runs useState, useEffect, etc., in the order defined.

// 3. Commit Phase
// 	‚Ä¢	React updates the real DOM based on what was returned by your components.
// 	‚Ä¢	Side effects inside useEffect run after the DOM is updated.

// ‚∏ª

// üîÅ What Triggers Re-renders?
// 	‚Ä¢	Props Change: Parent passes new data.
// 	‚Ä¢	State Change: useState updates.
// 	‚Ä¢	Context Change: Any change in context triggers re-render in all subscribers.
// 	‚Ä¢	Redux Store Change: Causes re-render if the useSelector dependency changes.

// ‚∏ª

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
// 	‚Ä¢	useNavigate, dispatch, etc. are stable (usually) but still functions, and React may treat them as updated depending on your build tool/hot reload behavior or wrapper implementations.
// 	‚Ä¢	Putting them in dependency arrays doesn‚Äôt always cause re-renders, but sometimes bundlers create new references. You observed it correctly!
